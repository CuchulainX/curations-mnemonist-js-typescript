## What's a data structure?

### Don't we already have fully satisfying data structures in JavaScript?

* `Array` ➡ lists of things
* `Object` ➡ key-value associations
* `Map` and `Set` with ES6

---

### Why would we want other data structures in JavaScript?

<Title affix="1.">Why?</Title>

<Title affix="1.1.">Convenience and bookkeeping</Title>

---

export default WideLayout

<Title affix="1.1.1." level={3}>A MultiSet</Title>

```js
// How about changing this:
var counts = {};

for (var item in something) {
  if (!(item in counts))
    counts[item] = 0;

  counts[item]++;
}
```

```js
// Into this:
var counts = new MultiSet();

for (var item in something)
  counts.add(item);
```

---

export default WideLayout

```js
// And what about this?
var counts = {};

for (var item in something) {
  if (!(item.key in counts))
    counts[item.key] = 0;

  counts[item.key] += item.value;

  // But value CAN be negative
  // and you don't want to keep items < 0
  if (counts[item.key] < 0)
    delete counts[item.key];
}
```

---

export default WideLayout

<Title affix="1.1.1." level={3}>A MultiSet</Title>

```js
// Still this:
var counts = new MultiSet();

for (var item in something)
  counts.add(item.value);
```

---

<Title affix="1.1.2." level={3}>Complex structures: a Graph</Title>

Sure, you can "implement" graphs using only `Array` and `Object`™.

But:

* Lots of bookkeeping (multi-way indexation)
* Wouldn't it be nice to have a legible interface?

---

Examples taken from the [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/) library:

```js
const graph = new Graph();

// Finding specific neighbors
const neighbors = graph.outNeighbors(node);

// Iterating over a node's edges
graph.forEachEdge(node, (edge, attributes) => {
  console.log(attributes.weight);
});
```

<Title affix="1.2.2." level={3}>Processing data in the client</Title>

* More and more doable
* No need for servers, good for privacy
* People want snappy interfaces
* Some algorithms require data structures (Dijkstra & heaps e.g.)

<Title affix="2.">What are the challenges?</Title>

---

<Title affix="1." level={3}>Interpreted languages are far from the metal</Title>

---

<Title affix="2." level={3}>No control over memory layout &amp; garbage collection</Title>

---

<Title affix="3." level={3}>JIT and optimizing engines such as Gecko and V8</Title>

---

TL,DR:<br />Benchmarking code accurately is **not** easy.

---

<Title affix="3.">Implementation tips</Title>

It does not mean we cannot be clever about it.

---

<Title affix="3.1." level={3}>Time &amp; memory performance</Title>

---

Basically, to develop efficient code in JavaScript, you must pretend really hard that:

1. The language has static typing.
2. That the language has no dynamically sized structures.

TODO: develop

---

1. minimize lookups
2. avoid creating objects & functions
3. Pointers malloc du pauvre
3. object vs. map
4. cost of function cost -> using stacks to simulate recursion

---

<Title affix="3.2." level={3}>Respecting the ecosystem</Title>

1. unshift shenaningans
2. Iterables, forEach, inspection in node

---

<Title affix="5.">References</Title>
